# Belly Button Diversity

Here is a rundown of the tools used in this web visualization exercise:

- **VS Code**: You will use a text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.
- **Web browser**: You will use a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. We will use Chrome in our examples.
- **Command-line interface**: You will use the command-line interface to run a local server. If you're a Mac user, this means Terminal. If you're a Windows user, you'll be using Git Bash.
- **GitHub**: As you will deploy your final data visualization on GitHub Pages, you will need your GitHub account.
